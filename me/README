Git checkout onto your DCOS Master.
Edit script.sh
Put in the DCOS master private ip into the variables for script.sh. Then put in the cryptoid for the root cluster.
MLB+Vhost is broken at the moment, so we add an app called haproxy-masters that just proxies the DAD masters on some random port from a public agent.


# How do I get into one of the containers?
docker exec -it <container-id> /bin/bash

# What are all of these directories?
bootstrap_serve gets parsed by script.sh to make various config files to boot the DAD cluster.
include is used to build the Docker image that gets used by DAD. I built one and added it to my Docker hub account so others don't have to build it.
haproxy-master is just used for now for the custom haproxy image.

#TODO
Change config.yaml

Change URI for env files in Marathon apps

Change bootstrapip+port in env files (genconf/serve/dcos-dad-envfile-*)+config.yaml

HAProxy config volume mount if wanted

Have journald for container be sent to stdout/stderr
Make SSH'ing into container easy.
